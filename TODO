General:
  - Proper context handling (use bpy.context only if really necessary)
  - Split finalize panel to apply and rig panels

Character management:
  - Unzipper for character/asset packages
  - Dependency analyser so you can delete characters without affecting other ones (may be tricky for textures)

Performance:
  - Fast YAML library

Art:
  - Compare bumping with MB-Lab?
  - More hairstyles

Char creation:
  - Asset list in creation panel
  - Alternative topologies from library

Morphing:
  - Manual sculpting mode
  - Shape rig morphing
  - Allow to mix L1 shapes?

Finalize:
  - Choice between materials displacement and displacement modifier

Materials:
  - Texture sets (4K/8K for Reom, maybe different resultions for Antonia too)
  - Skin coloring for Antonia
  - Lip color control?
  - Ability to disable skin features (blush, freckles)
    and completely remove them from node tree removing unneccessary texture images too
  - Texture layers?

Reom:
  - More symmetry fixes

Randomize:
  - Randomize eye and skin colors

Hair:
  - Import scalp vertex groups only when necessary so VG cleanup on finalize won't be necessary anymore
  - Lichtso hair engine
  - Move hair.blend to char.blend?
  - Hair refitting after edit

Fitting:
  - MakeHuman asset support ?
  - Bounding box transform?
  - More fitting settings? (Thresholds and so on)
  - Asset baking?
  - Ability to select MB-Lab fitting algorithm
  - Use avg instead of max for thresh? I think no, we need to use no less than first n

Assets:
  - Asset-defined heels and morphs
  - Use default underwear assets instead of censors -- done for Antonia
  - Image browser for clothes and hair

Rigging:
  - Fix Reom's eyelashes
  - Force bone bending angle
  - Generate rig from metarig
  - Use VertexWeightProximity for folding knees, elbows and belly
  - Import MB-Lab and Antonia expression shape keys alongside with Rigify
  - Add chest and abdomen bones for breathing -- done for Antonia
  - Pupil dilation bones -- done for Antonia
  - Size and limb length morphs for Antonia
  - Relative rigger instead of current absolute one?
  - Head pivot shift
  - Live regular rig deform
  - Deformation cage support? (it seems that better fitting algorighm is needed for it)
  - Rigify morphing? Maybe even create an own Rigify-like rig system?
  - Blenrig?

Editing:
  - Automatic material converter (It took quite a while to convert Reom's materials)
  - Refine for XL recalc
  - MB-Lab import/export tools
  - Export L2__Body_Size_min back to MB-Lab

Pose:
  - Fix glitchy capture poses
  - Different mix modes
  - Native pose support (not just MB-Lab)
