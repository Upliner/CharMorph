LICENSE OF THE DATABASE
=======================

Each character has its own license stated in select list.
CharMorph contains MB-Lab characters that are based on
ManuelbastioniLAB package, all the meshes and data contained
in these directories including .blend files,
all the images and all the json, yaml files are released

LICENSE OF MODELS GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE.
============================================

The AGPL can be an obstacle in case someone wants to create a closed
source game or closed source 3D models using 3D characters made with
the lab because the AGPL will propagate from the base models and from
the database to the output models. Please use CC-BY models if you want
to avoid it.

- License of MB-Lab characters is AGPL 3: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html.
  As derived product of the AGPL'd database, the models must be
  distribuited under AGPL 3, with the same copyright of the database.


LICENSE OF RENDERS GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE.
============================================

Rendered two-dimensional images or two-dimensional videos of a scene that includes 3D models generated
with this addon are not considered a derived product of the licensed 3D database and 3D base models.
Assuming that the rendering depicts a non-reverse-engineering scene[*], due to many factors
(i.e. the transformation from 3D space to 2D space, the position and the type of camera used,
the other 3D elements included in the scene, the position and type of lights, the post production,
the composition of multiple characters, the path of the camera, ecc.) the original 3D data is
fundamentally modified and transformed sufficiently that it constitutes an original work.

For this reason, the author of the 2D rendering is the sole copyright owner of 2D image/video
created by him and the sole responsible for the use of his 2D image/video.

Also the author of the 2D rendering can use any license for the two-dimensional image/video
created by him and of course he can use his two-dimensional image/video for commercial projects.

[*] For example, an orthographic rendering of a shadeless plane with lab textures on it,
will be considered as reverse engineering scene for textures extraction.
